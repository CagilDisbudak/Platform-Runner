# Platform-Runner

The User's character and NPCs cannot move in Unity and start to go backwards, but as this situation increases the speed of the characters, 
there is no such situation in the game engine.

But when we build the game, such a bug does not appear as an apk file. 
When we run it while in the game engine, it does not appear properly. 
For this, it is necessary to make the game apk first and then make the changes.
